## Notes on linux lesson
- We can use basic commands to help review versions, update repositories, and many other things
  - git clone; allows me to clone a repository from the cloud and work in that repository in vscode
  - git push & git pull; git push allows me to commit my repository changes to the cloud, git pull allows me to pull code from the cloud onto my repository
  - version checks; once I have committed to github, I can go to the github website and check actions to see if my latest version is working
  - cat; reads data and provides content for it to output
  - cd $project; allows me to move into the directory of a certain project
  - .git; establishes a connection between my machine and the github server
