# JS Input/Output Findings
- It is very important to utilize the console to see how we can potentially work out our problems
-  We can use the console (via toggle developer tools) to perform different commands
    - var () = : Creates a variable that delivers a certain output when a given input is put into the console
    - console.log() : Saves a variable that we have created so that we can later use it in command lines
    - array : An array is a way for us to string together variables in order to have sequenced outputs 

# Calculator Editing Findings
- We had to turn to ChatGPT on multiple occassions when we hit roadblocks
- Mr. Mortensen directed us towards utilizing different prompts in order to problem solve since Chat-GPT 
- We discovered that the background animations were locked and thus we could not incorporate them into the background of our .MD/.IPYNB calculators
- What we were able to add:
    - JS Input
        - Tables that display value 1 and value 2
        - Achieving the average of two values
    - .MD Calculator
        - CHange coloring
        - Add multiple functions

# Use of Agile Methodology
- We split up the work once we had established out work in order to minimize the amount of developing each one of us would have indivudally had to do
    - Trevor worked on completing the .MD calculator with Nate
    - Andrew and Dean worked on completing the JS input calculator
    - We reconvened to put together a blog post with all of our findings
