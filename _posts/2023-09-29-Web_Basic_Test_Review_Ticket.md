# HTML
I was able to use the lesson and my knowledge of HTML to design an output that follows the structure of the assigned wireframe. Both of my links function and the button I created is assigned to toggle a gif on and off when pressed.

# Basics of JS
I was able to create two variables with JS that correpsond to randomly generated numbers. When run, the code compares these two variables and prints a message given the numerical relationship between the two numbers.

# JS with Data Types
I was able to create an object and log it in console with characteristics of myself and values that correspond to me

# JS with HTML
I was able to create a function that switches the two links and displays the corresponding text "switched". The output works on VSCode, but the links don't switch on my local server or on github.io.

# JS Errors
I corrected all 3 errors in the notebook and added some of my own functionality to one of the code cells commencerate with going above the base requirement for credit.
