## Week 2 Accomplishments
- I started setting up my lab notebook, figuring out how to add posts and record my findings
- Updated my repository to the latest version published by Mr. Mortensen
- Added the snake game as a post onto my lab notebook
- Worked with pair to prepare for lab notebook check on Thursday

## Week 2 Findings
- For now, I can't have a separate labnotebook.md header, need to keep all posts under compsci.md
